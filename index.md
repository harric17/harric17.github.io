## Introduction

<p>My project Shiny app is hosted at <a href="http://harric17.shinyapps.io/project/">this website</a>.
</p>

<p>This is a simple app that uses "melanom" dataset form the ISwR package in R.  The app gets Kaplan-Meier survival parameter estimates based on the stratifications specified.  As long as the user knows how to operate a pulldown menu they should have no problem using this app.</p>
