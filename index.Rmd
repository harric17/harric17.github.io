## Introduction

My project Shiny app is hosted at the following website:

http://harric17.shinyapps.io/project/

This is a simple app that uses "melanom" dataset form the ISwR package in R.  The app gets Kaplan-Meier survival parameter estimates based on the stratifications specified.  As long as the user knows how to operate a pulldown menu they should have no problem using this app.
